# About Me
Hi, my name is Katherine Li and I am currently a third year computer science major at the University of California, Irvine. 

Here are some files to look at to see my programming skills. Under the Rose Hacks file, you will see my contribution to the twenty four hour hackathon that I participated recently in January 2020. In the other files, you will see my programming approach to several problems that I have encountered. 

Files to look at: 
Under Right-way (My Rosehacks hackathon project that I worked on with three other people):
app.py : In this file, you will see functions that I helped write to find the rating of a used car. 
getAPI.py : In this file, I used the Car Query API to extract data on a specific model of a car
