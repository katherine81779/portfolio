# About Me
Hi, my name is Katherine Li and I am currently a third year student studying computer science at the University of California, Irvine. I strive for perfection, and am willing to take risks and complete challenges. My love for problem solving and technology has led me to develop an interest and passion for programming. I am always ready to take on new tasks, and ecstatic to learn more.

Here are some files to look at to see my programming skills. Under the Rose Hacks folder, you will see my contribution to the twenty-four hour hackathon that I participated recently in January 2020 with three other teammates. In the other files, you will see my programming approach to several problems that I have encountered. 

# Files to look at: 
Under right-way (My Rosehacks hackathon project that I worked on with three other people):

app.py
- Creating an algorithm with multiple functions that helped me find the rating of a used car. 
getAPI.py
 -In this file, I used the Car Query API to extract data on a specific model of a car
 
 
 
 maxDepthBinaryTree.py
 - Demonstrates my knowledge of iterating through a Binary Tree
 
 reverseLinkedList.py
  - Shows that I can iterate through a Linked List in O(N) time while reversing it
  
  twoSum.py
  - Utilizes a dictionary and finds the target value with two indices that match the value in a list within O(N) time 
  
  validParentheses.py
  - Represents how I understand the purpose of utilizing a stack, and finds if the String input is a valid use of parentheses
